            <center>12 Zodiac Signs: Dates and Personality Traits of Each Star Sign</center>
        </b></h1>

    <big>In Western astrology, and formerly astronomy, the <b><i>zodiac</i></b> is divided into twelve
        signs, each occupying 30<sup>°</sup> of celestial longitude and roughly corresponding to the
        following <b><i>star constellations</i></b></big>:
    <ul>
        <li><a href="#s">Aries</a></li>
        <li><a href="#s">Taurus</a></li>
        <li><a href="#s">Gemini</a></li>
        <li><a href="#s">Cancer</a></li>
        <li><a href="#s">Leo</a></li>
        <li><a href="#s">Virgo</a></li>
        <li><a href="#s">Libra</a></li>
        <li><a href="#s">Scorpio</a></li>
        <li><a href="#s">Sagittarius</a></li>

                    <ins><i>Astrology</i></ins> is a pseudoscience. Scientific investigations of the theoretical basis
                    and experimental
                    verification of claims have shown it to have no scientific validity or explanatory power. More
                    plausible
                    explanations for the apparent correlation between personality traits and birth months exist, such as
                    the influence of seasonal birth in humans.
                    <br>
                    According to <ins><i>astrology</i></ins>, celestial phenomena relate to human activity on the
                    principle of
                    "as above, so below", so that the signs are held to represent characteristic modes of
                    expression. Scientific astronomy used the same sectors of the ecliptic as Western astrology until
                    the 19th century.
                    <br>
                    Various approaches to measuring and dividing the sky are currently used by differing systems of
                    astrology, although the tradition
                    of the Zodiac's names and symbols remain mostly consistent. Western astrology measures from Equinox
                    and Solstice points (points relating
                    to equal, longest, and shortest days of the tropical year), while Hindu astrology measures along the
                    equatorial plane (sidereal year).
